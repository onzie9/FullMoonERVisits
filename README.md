# FullMoonERVisits
A quick analysis of NEISS-AIP numbers compared to moon phases.

The 2017 NEISS-AIP data were sorted by moon phase and a count was taken.  Moon phases were taken in 5% intervals.  New moon was 0% illuminated, full moon was 100% illuminated, and then back to 0% again.  

With this basic approach, peaks in the numbers of ER visits were shown around the full moon, as popular culture espouses as fact, and around the new moon, which is not typically mentioned.

Further analysis is done by scaling each 5% illumination interval to the proper percentage of time of the 28-day lunar cycle.  For example, the moon spends only 1.7831% between 25% illumination and 30% illumination as opposed to 2.5% if the phases progressed linearly.

After the scaling of time was done, the resulting injury numbers were random, confirming what numerous studies have already shown.
