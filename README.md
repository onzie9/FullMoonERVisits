# FullMoonERVisits
A quick analysis of NEISS-AIP numbers compared to moon phases.

The 2017 NEISS-AIP data were sorted by moon phase and a count was taken.  Moon phases were taken in 5% intervals.  New moon was 0% illuminated, full moon was 100% illuminated, and then back to 0% again.  

With this basic approach, peaks in the numbers of ER visits were shown around the full moon, as popular culture espouses as fact, and around the new moon, which is not typically mentioned.

Further analysis is done by using a lunar illumination formula directly. This formula computes the percentage of illumination based on the day of the lunar cycle.  This is a sinusoidal curve, whereas the original claim assumes it is linear.  From there, the analysis runs essentially the same, but gives the more accurate result of ER visits being random.
